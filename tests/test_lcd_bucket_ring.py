"""Regression tests for the streamed-LCD bucket ring and HID read desyncs.

Hardware-free: a fake stands in for the pinned liquidctl Kraken Z3 driver and
models the two firmware behaviours that broke LCD streaming in the field.

* The bucket currently on screen cannot be deleted (the firmware answers 0x09),
  and a bucket whose delete was refused cannot then be set up (0x04).
* A reply can be crowded out of liquidctl's 12-report read budget by other
  traffic on the shared HID stream, which surfaces as
  ``AssertionError("missing messages ...")``.

Run with:  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
