"""Control engine for OpenKraken.

This module owns *all* periodic work in the application: device polling, system
sensor sampling, software-curve duty computation, LCD sensor-screen rendering and
reconnection handling.  It runs on its own :class:`~PyQt6.QtCore.QThread` so the GUI
thread never touches :class:`~openkraken.backend.device.KrakenDevice` or
:class:`~openkraken.backend.sensors.SystemSensors` directly.

The GUI interacts with the engine in exactly two ways:

* It listens to Qt signals (:data:`ControlEngine.sample_ready`,
  :data:`ControlEngine.connection_changed`, :data:`ControlEngine.applied`,
  :data:`ControlEngine.error`).  These are emitted from the engine thread and are
  auto-queued to the GUI thread by Qt.
* It calls the thread-safe request methods (:meth:`ControlEngine.apply_channel`,
  :meth:`ControlEngine.apply_lcd`, :meth:`ControlEngine.request_reconnect`,
  :meth:`ControlEngine.update_config`, :meth:`ControlEngine.stop`).  Each of these
  merely enqueues a closure onto an internal :class:`queue.Queue`; the run loop
  drains the queue (non-blocking) on every tick and performs the work itself.

The run loop wakes every ``config.poll_interval`` seconds but sleeps in slices of at
most :data:`_SLEEP_SLICE` so :meth:`ControlEngine.stop` is responsive.
